You are an expert WebGL and three.js developer. 
Create a COMPLETE interactive 3D web app (HTML + CSS + JavaScript in one project) that runs in the browser.

GOAL:
A realistic-looking SPACE SIMULATOR where I can:
- View a SOLAR SYSTEM
- Zoom out to see the whole MILKY WAY GALAXY
- Focus on BLACK HOLES (with accretion disk effects)
- Control camera, time speed, and what is visible
- Customize colors, sizes, speeds in a simple way

TECH:
- Use three.js (via CDN) for 3D rendering.
- Use standard HTML/CSS for UI (no frameworks).
- Make sure it runs smoothly on a normal laptop.

SCENE REQUIREMENTS:

1. GENERAL SPACE LOOK
- Dark starfield background (stars as particles + a background texture).
- Slight nebula / dust effect in the galaxy view to make space look rich.
- Add soft lighting so planets and objects feel 3D and not flat.

2. SOLAR SYSTEM MODE
- A star (the Sun) with glow.
- At least 8 planets with:
  - Correct relative ORDER (Mercury → Neptune).
  - Different sizes and colors (not physically perfect but believable).
  - Circular or slightly elliptical orbits.
- Simple orbit physics:
  - Use basic circular motion (don’t need full realistic N-body physics, but motion should LOOK smooth and natural).
- Add some moons (e.g., Earth’s moon, Jupiter’s major moon) orbiting planets.
- Show orbit paths as faint circles.

3. GALAXY / MILKY WAY MODE
- When I zoom out / switch mode:
  - Show a spiral galaxy (top view) made of many glowing particles representing stars.
  - Spiral arms rotating slowly around the center.
- At the center, place a SUPER MASSIVE BLACK HOLE:
  - Black sphere with:
    - Accretion disk (glowing disk of particles or textured ring rotating very fast).
    - Subtle gravitational lensing effect if possible (or fake it with shaders/textures).
- Option to place a few smaller black holes elsewhere in the galaxy visible as dark centers with small glowing disks.

4. BLACK HOLE FOCUS
- Add a button or toggle to "Focus on Black Hole":
  - Camera smoothly moves to orbit around the central black hole.
  - Time speed increases for accretion disk rotation.
  - Dim surrounding lights slightly to make the black hole area more dramatic.

CONTROLS (VERY IMPORTANT):

Implement controls using JavaScript + basic HTML UI:

- Camera:
  - Mouse drag to rotate.
  - Mouse wheel to zoom in/out.
  - Right-click or middle mouse to pan.
  - OR use OrbitControls from three.js.

- Modes (buttons or toggles on screen):
  - "Solar System View"
  - "Galaxy View"
  - "Focus Black Hole"

- Time Control:
  - Slider: time speed (e.g. 0x – 5x).
  - Button: Play/Pause motion.

- Object Visibility Toggles:
  - Checkbox: show/hide orbit paths.
  - Checkbox: show/hide labels (planet names, black holes, etc.).
  - Checkbox: show/hide starfield background.

CUSTOMIZATION PANEL:

Create a simple UI panel on one side of the screen where I can easily tweak values in code later. 
Provide CLEAR COMMENTS in the JS file for these variables:

- Planet size multiplier.
- Planet orbit speed multiplier.
- Galaxy rotation speed.
- Black hole accretion disk color.
- Background star brightness.
- Number of stars in galaxy.

Make it easy to change these by editing a CONFIG object, like:

const CONFIG = {
  planetSizeMultiplier: 1.0,
  orbitSpeedMultiplier: 1.0,
  galaxyRotationSpeed: 0.1,
  accretionDiskColor: 0xffaa00,
  starBrightness: 1.0,
  galaxyStarCount: 5000,
};

VISUAL QUALITY:
- Use smooth animations with requestAnimationFrame.
- Enable antialiasing for the renderer.
- Add a subtle bloom/glow/post-processing effect if possible, but keep performance in mind.
- Make the UI look clean and modern with simple CSS (no ugly default buttons).

CODE STRUCTURE:
- index.html: basic layout with canvas + UI controls.
- style.css: styling for full-screen 3D canvas and control panel.
- main.js: all three.js setup and logic.
- Organize JS code into functions:
  - initScene()
  - initSolarSystem()
  - initGalaxy()
  - initBlackHole()
  - initUI()
  - animate()
- Comment the code well so I can understand and customize objects easily.

EXTRA DETAILS:
- Add labels (small sprites or HTML overlays) for key objects: Sun, Earth, Milky Way Center, Black Hole.
- Make camera transitions between modes smooth with tweening (if you use a tween library, load it via CDN).

Finally:
- Make sure the project runs immediately when I click “Run” in Replit.
- Do NOT leave TODOs. Implement all features in a finished, working way.
